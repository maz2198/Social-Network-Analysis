# Social Network Analysis

This repo represents our main project completed during the Social Network Analysis course. We chose to analyse Forced Migration, to dispell the notion of a eurocentric refugee crisis. Various libraries (igraph, sna, tsna, ndtv & networkX) in R and Python to compute the general centrality measures. Gephi and flowmap were used for more complex calculations such as community detection.
